<p>In 1797 the composer Francis Joseph Haydn, who was Mozart's teacher and Beethoven's mentor composed a song for Francis the Second, who was the grandfather of the Emperor Maximilian of Habsburg; later this melody written by Hayden, became Germany´s National Anthem. Maximilian of Habsburg was the direct cousin of Queen Victoria from England, he married Charlotte Amalia, who was the Princess of Belgium and the only daughter of one of the richest men at that time. During the wedding of both, a member of the Strauss dynasty played. Months before the death of Maximilian, plenty of battles were taking place in Querétaro, between the group of Liberals and Conservatives; in the group of Liberals there was a member that was the father of Juventino Rosas, who was a recognized Mexican composer, whose waltz “Over the Waves” crossed borders and appears in Disney movies; also related to Disney, the castle in which Walt Disney got inspired to build his own; was the castle of Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, the owner and the one who built that castle was the king of Bavaria Ludwig II, who was nephew of Emperor Maximilian. The importance of Maximilian and his relatives has impacted the world in many forms, for that reason I released for the first time, in the history of the place where he was executed; the waltz dedicated to him, in the 153 anniversary of his execution.</p> 
<p>Nowadays, the royal monarchies are seen as a fantasy nice story all around the world, Emmanuel has the perfect argument to perform this Waltz as a memory to the Emperor and his family, in all the places of the world that are related to them, like France, Belgium, Germany or Austria; by organizing cultural events that gather distinct manifestations of arts in a special Emperor Gala.</p>
