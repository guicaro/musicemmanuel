<p>I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration I got from the <a href="https://www.uaq.mx" target="_blank">Autonomous University of Queretaro</a> back in 2010. My main focus these days is on composing, playing the piano and the bass. Given my passion for music, I decided to pursue a bachelor’s in music at the City of Austin, Texas (the world capital of Live Music). With my music, my main goal is to create emotion, whether that is a positive or negative feeling is ok as long as it moves my listeners. Broadly speaking, I categorize my music into world music, because it includes different styles of music from multiple places. So far I've performed my own compositions in United States, Mexico, Russia, Spain and India.</p>
<p>In 2019 Emmanuel I represented the state of Queretaro in a National project called “Sonorous Laboratory” with other composers of other states of Mexico. My works have been performed by Jose White quartet, the band of the city of Burgos (Spain), the state band of Queretaro, the classic band of Oaxaca, the symphony orchestra of Querétaro.</p> 
<p>I enjoy taking music and shows to people who are not able to attend musical events. Listening itself and watching something different from the ordinary helps make people who are suffering from pain or disease clear their mind and forget their problems. These forms of performance can take place in hospitals or nursing homes.</p>
<p>I joined <a href="https://swansongs.org" target="_blank">Swan Songs</a> last year, a United States non-profit foundation, that fulfills musical last wishes by organizing private concerts for individuals with a terminal illness or nearing the end of life. At no cost to the family, a favorite style of music or regional musician is brought directly to the home or care facility. Committed to supporting live music in the community. The concert allows patient, family, and friends to focus beyond the illness and come together through the medium of music.</p>
<p>Most recently, I have taken a role as an organizer of the first edition of the <a href="https://festivalflamencodesantiago.com/" target="_blank">International Flamenco Festival Santiago 2020</a>, it gathers the best of Flamenco in the world.</p>
