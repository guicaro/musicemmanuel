        <p>Most of the people that have gone to war, even if they where not directly in a combat zone involves being out of their homes and away from loved ones. These sacrifices have the purpose to serve a country and deservers even more merit. Any person who has served a nation deserves recognition.</p>
        <p>By doing a presentation, for veterans, with a small or large music group, I would like to honor the work they have done and recognize all the generations that have gone to war. My admiration for the composer John Philip Souza, known as “The King of Marches”, creator of the National March and pioneer of military music in the United States inspired me to get back on those times (1800s). There exists a relationship between John Philip Souza and his origin from Sevilla, Spain. One of the important cities of Flamenco; an important style in my music.</p>
