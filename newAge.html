<p>I would also call this type of music, “Reflection Music”;  the perfect music to listen to when we meditate or reflect on the multiple moments we experience throughout our lives, such as: happiness, sadness, anxiety, frustration, etc. All my compositions are oriented to the same destination; finding peace, harmony and clearing the mind. </p>

<li><strong>Angels & Archangels</strong>: A spiritual melody that reflects the beauty of kindness, dedicated to Michael,  an archangel that is recognized in Islam, Judaism and Christianity. For me, an Angel is not only the one who has wings and shares messages; an Angel can be the person that doesn’t know who we are, and yet they offer us help without expecting anything in return. The song includes passages with the voice of children, who resort to archangels for protection, the tenor’s voice chants phrases written in the popular Benedict Medal and the musical movements sound like a Harp, an instrument associated to angels. All the lyrics are in Latin, the parent language for the majority of languages.</li>
