        <p>All around the globe, each town or city the majority of time always has a site that apparently is haunted; the rumors of the place usually become popular and are known by any person of the community. Even if the stories are false and not proven, the place has the reputation of “being hunted”. For the most part; these places tend to be schools, hospitals, old buildings and historic places. The perfect proof that the supernatural or paranormal topic causes interest to people is the multiple channels that dedicate programming to this topic, such is the case of Discovery Chanel or Animal Planet. Tourism is another aspect that demonstrates the interest of people in visiting these types of places, just like the multiple offerings of ghost tours in the world.</p> 
<p>I have always liked the unexplained mysteries and considering how important this topic is for the  film industry, I composed several melodies inspired in the sensations that belong to the paranormal. I released a series of macabre compositions played in a convent that was built in the year 1752 It later became a hospital that worked for several years. Of course, with the time this place gave birth to apparent “ghost stories”. The concert was combined with a representation by professional actors of the more outstanding legends of the building, the proposal was successfully accepted by the audience, this same model can be presented in any part of the world.</p>
