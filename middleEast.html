<p>My purpose is to simulate being in the Middle East; the dessert, surrounded with palm trees, Jazmin fragrance and clear sky. The “Masreq area” has very important places for world history, such as United Arab Emirates, Lebanon, Jerusalem and Saudi Arabia. These type of rhythms, intervals and music scales have existed for thousands of years delighting generations in this geographic area.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Jerusalem</strong>: The three more important monotheistic religions in the word (Jewish, Islam & Christian), consider Jerusalem a sacred city. The stones used to build the walls, the green tone of the olive’s trees combined with the pure blue sky and the desert hot weather makes this city a peaceful, beautiful, contemplative and good vibe kind of place.</li>
  <li><strong>Lomelin</strong>: India, part Asia and part of the Middle East, has a millenary history. A lot of continents have similar cultures, like Europe or Latin America, but India in its food, its people, languages, animals, and religion is unique. Places like the palaces in Rajasthan or Taj Mahal in Agra make you feel as if you traveled back to those days where the kings ruled under beautiful nights with stars. India is also important because it is where flamenco originated.</li>
