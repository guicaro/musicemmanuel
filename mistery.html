<p>Sometimes also called spooky or macabre. In the course of humanity, there has always existed the sensation of fear, suspense and mystery for what is unknown or the things that are impossible to explain logically, I tried to capture those feelings in this music proposal, without leaving behind illustrating musically the customs and traditions like Halloween, that takes places during the season of Fall, where the full moon facet appears with the predominating orange color of pumpkins and fallen leaves.  </p>
<p>At the moment all compositions can be found in <a href="https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/" target="_blank">Sheet Music Plus</a>. I will be adding scores as they become available</p>

    <p><strong>The Warren Legacy</strong>: The last name Warren is highly associated with the most famous couple in the paranormal world thanks to research they have made and the sequence of more than seven movies (ex. The Conjuring or Anabelle).</p>
    <p>In my opinion, those movies are the most terrific in the last decades, maybe because they are inspired in recent true events. The reason which I decided to do this song, is mainly to recognize the Warren Organization and how they help people without charging anything. Also, I was really impressed while listening to Chris McKinnell’s experiences and comparing how similar they were to the movies.</p>
    <p>Chris McKinnell is the director of the Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research, which carries on the work of his grandparents, Ed and Lorraine Warren. He began working with the Warrens in 1980, at the age of 16. He has assisted or led investigations on some of the Warrens’ most famous cases, as well as several thousands others. He now leads an international network of paranormal researchers that continue the Warrens’ mission all over the world.</p>

    <p>The Warren Legacy Foundation for Paranormal Research is a worldwide network of dedicated experts from many diverse fields of study, working together to study the paranormal, teach the public and future generations of researchers, aid psychics with their abilities, and help those troubled by the paranormal. </p>
    <p>It was interesting to me how in the Museum of Occultism (unique in the world), one can  find all the cursed objects that Ed and Lorraine Warren collected, during their more than 4000 cases. Each object has its own story, but I found these to be very scary: The tiger Fur, when the tiger lived it killed 33 persons in India, the piano owned by a priest that plays itself in the middle of the nigh, the rocking chair where nobody can sit and finally the dangerous doll; worse than Anabelle, apparently, just looking at it becomes dangerous for people.</p>
    <p>I have no doubt that there are several movies to come in the next years even if it’s just to show the story behind many of these objects.</p>

    <p><strong>The nun painting</strong>:Thanks to the investigations that the city ​​chronicler kindly shared with me, and my personal interview with direct witnesses; I started to put attention to an old painting that apparently was haunted. With time and with more curious stories surrounding it, I decided to make this song because in the world, haunted paintings do exist, but there are only a few.</p>
    <p>So, a beautiful oil painting related with a Nun in love, created an interesting romance combination, to be shown to large groups of people around the world, that enjoy hearing from these kind of stories.</p>

    <p>It all began in the XVIII Century, where Ana María de San Francisco y Neve, was forced by her parents to enter to the convent because she was in love with a man. Since her family was poor, they did not had enough money to pay the dowry (a payment used in those times for women that would marry). Ana María was a novice in the process to become nun, and many historians agree that she hung herself because of her disappointment of being on the convent without her love. </p>
    <p>When she was alive, she was painted on a big canvas by an unknown author. The temple and convent where all this happened, was built in 1752, through the years it became a hospital, but today remains as a church and abbey.</p>
    <p>What people say in relation to this painting, is that during the night the same nun of the painting, like if it would be magic; comes out of the portrait and wonders through the halls of the church while levitating. The people who admire the painting in person feel that her eyes follow the observer. There was an occasion where a woman who worked on the church for more than ten years would always feel fear while passing through the painting. One randomly and unexpected day, just when she arrived at her home, she surprisingly saw the same nun, reason why some people believe it can follow the ones who see it.</p>
