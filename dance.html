<p>I try to illustrate the night life scene. I expose the euphoric sensation when we are on a joyful celebrating mood that motivates us to start dancing. In terms of music, the chord progressions that generally appear in this type of music sometimes can be addictive to the brain. Thus, the subconscious does not want the melody to stop because it is pleasant to the ear.</p>

  <li><strong>Friday night party</strong>: Friday for most people means, the end of a routine and the beginning of a break to clear the mind. For youth, the first party weekends of teenage life are always remembered.</li>
  <li><strong>Having you</strong>: It can be a person, a place or a pet, but most of the people have felt the sense of missing somebody. This is the main essence behind the lyrics I decided to put into this song.</li>
